Blackbird Quantum Assembly Language
===================================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

Blackbird is a quantum assembly language for continuous-variable quantum computation, that can be
used to program Xanadu's quantum photonics hardware and Strawberry Fields simulator.


Features
--------

The Blackbird repository contains three *separate* packages:

* ``src``: The Blackbird grammar specification in enhanced Brackus-Naur form

* ``blackbird_python``: to develop Blackbird parsers for integration with Python programs

* ``blackbird_cpp``: libraries and header files needed to develop Blackbird
  parsers for integration with C++ programs

All of these packages are independent, and can be installed separately without
depending on one-another. *However*, if the grammar is ever modified, there
is an command for updating the autogenerated parts of the Python and C++
parsers.

In addition, this repository contains:

* ``example``: Example Blackbird scripts

* ``apps``: Example Python/C++ applications using the above parsers


Getting started
---------------

To get the Blackbird grammar installed and running on your system, begin at the :ref:`grammar installation guide <installation>`. Then, familiarize yourself with Blackbird's :ref:`syntax and grammar <syntax>` for specifying photonic quantum circuits. You can even generate Blackbird parsers for any target language supported by ANTLR, including Java, C#, JavaScript, Go, and Swift.

If you only want to develop an application that makes use of the Python parser or the C++ parser, you can go directly to those sections and their corresponding installation guides.
